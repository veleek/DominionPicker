These icons were made by Pawel Pawlak (morris@elysium.pl). They are not identical to Dominion icons, they are just well made look-a-likes.

The individual icons are provided in four formats:
- Adobe Illustrator (*.ai)
- Scalable Vector Graphics (*.svg)
- Enhanced MetaFile (*.emf)
- Portable Network Graphics (*.png) - with transparency

Furthermore, all the icons together are provided in native Xara Designer Pro 7 format (*.xar) - but the file should be readable by
any previous Xara Xtreme version (I've tried Xara Xtreme 4 with success).

If you do not have Xara and wish to have the icons in another format not listed here, please contact me and I'll see what I can do
(I'm limited to Xara export capabilities, though).
